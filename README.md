- Started Learning about streamlit
- started finding good projects to make, to increase the knowledge of streamlit.
- continued learning about the attention model. 


## week 2
### *27th May 2024*
- *Meeting*: The changes in the website were briefly discussed again.
- I was asked to learn advanced streamlit so that the process of development would not take that much time.


### *Here is the Outine of Week-2:*

1. Rediscussing Project Requirements.
2. Asked to learn advanced streamlit.
3. Making streamlit projects for project based learning.
