     1. Making toggle buttons.
     2. how to use API's for using functionalities of differnt webisites.
     3. learning about columns and tickers.

### Day 3: Implimented ML for prediction
- Implimented ML for the stock price prediction.
- Displaying it on proper graphs.
- https://github.com/AniruddhMukherjee/Streamlit-predicton-app.git

### Day 4: Taking the wireframes
- The wireframe for the website was given to me and had to make it like that compeletely using streamlit.
- Started making basic outline of the website.
  
### Day 5: Number of Pages and Navigation

    4. categories
    5. Questionnaire
- I was given the outline of projects page and i started working on the navigation between pages so that i can work on the seperate pages later on.
- I made the navigation usning the sidebar but later i was asked to make the navigation bar on the top and should be horizonatal so after a pain striking process of searching the web i found about (options_menu) which brought the navigation bar up and worked fine for connecting different pages.



## week 4
### *10th June 2024*
- Started working on the project and making the respective pages
- learnt about new and imporoved features of streamlit

### *Here is the Outine of Week-4:*
1. Creating the projects page.
2. Creating the documents page.
3. Working on the categories page.


## üìù Day-by-Day Progress

### Day 1: The Projects Page
- Started working on the projects age which is basically a projects display page and we can also add/ delete the projects.
- The adding and deleting of the projects was figured out and it worked fine and all the features worked.
- The projects were displayed in a simple streamlit table.

### Day 2: The Documents Page Confusion
- After the basic outline of the projects page I started working on the documents page and I made the basic outline like the projects page.
- After discussing with the mentor i came to know that we had to create different documents table for differnt projects.
- Started working on the idea that different projects should have a differnt table for themselfes.

### Day 3: The Project Document Connection
- Started working on the connection of the proejcts and the Documents page.
- This specific task was to open a all together new table for different projects.
- If differnt documents are saved in different projects, it hsould stay like that and should not coincide.

### Day 4: The Categories Page
- A categories page was made which was a simple page and was compeleted in a single day.
- The categories input in the categories page were made such so that even the projects page had access to them and could be used for assingning differnt categories for differnt projects.

### Day 5: The Editble Table Problem
- The outline of the pages were accepted but a altogether new challenge was given and it was editable tables
- The Idea was to have editable tables and almost all the changes should be done from the table and there should not be many buttons in the entire page
- After spending the entire day on youtube and differnt website i came accross something known as AgGrid.



## week 5
