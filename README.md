2. Asked to learn advanced streamlit.
3. Making streamlit projects for project-based learning.


## üìù Day-by-Day Progress

### Day 1: Rediscussing about the requirements
- We discussed a bit about the project about how and what changes need to be made so that the website is more user-friendly and not clustered.

### Day 2: Learning Streamit

- https://github.com/AniruddhMukherjee/Streamlit-projects.git

### Day 5: Starting Big Project
- Took up a big project that used almost half of the imp features of Streamlit and made some of it on Friday.


## week 3
### *03rd June 2024*
- Work was assigned at the end of this week until I started making the project and finished before I got the actual project.

### *Here is the Outline of Week 3:*

1. Completed the stock price dashboard app.
2. implemented machine learning for stock price prediction.
3. work was assigned and the basic outline of pages was given which was supposed to be made.

## üìù Day-by-Day Progress

### Day 1: Project Continuation
- Continued making the project of the stock dashboard and learned about how different types of tables and data frames can be implemented.
- How the range for dates can be set for more accurate prediction and analysis.

### Day 2: Project Continuation
- Completed the stock price dashboard and solved all the errors.
- Learned about all the important tasks like:
     1. Making toggle buttons.
     2. how to use API's for using functionalities of different websites.
     3. learning about columns and tickers.

### Day 3: Implemented ML for prediction
- Implemented ML for the stock price prediction.
- Displaying it on proper graphs.
- https://github.com/AniruddhMukherjee/Streamlit-predicton-app.git

### Day 4: Taking the wireframes
- The wireframe for the website was given to me and had to make it like that completely using Streamlit.
- Started making a basic outline of the website.
  
### Day 5: Number of Pages and Navigation
- I had to make a total of 5 Pages:
    1. Projects
    2. documents
    3. reports
    4. categories
    5. Questionnaire
- I was given the outline of the projects page and I started working on the navigation between pages so that I could work on the separate pages later on.
- I made the navigation using the sidebar but later I was asked to make the navigation bar on the top and horizontal so after a painful striking process of searching the web I found (options_menu) which brought the navigation bar up and worked fine for connecting different pages.



## week 4
### *10th June 2024*
- Started working on the project and making the respective pages
- learning about new and improved features of Streamlit

### *Here is the Outine of Week-4:*
1. Creating the projects page.
2. Creating the documents page.
3. Working on the categories page.


## üìù Day-by-Day Progress

### Day 1: The Projects Page
- Started working on the project's age which is basically a project display page and we can also add/ delete the projects.
- The adding and deleting of the projects was figured out and it worked fine and all the features worked.
- The projects were displayed in a simple streamlit table.

### Day 2: The Documents Page Confusion
- After the basic outline of the projects page I started working on the documents page and I made the basic outline like the projects page.
- After discussing with the mentor I came to know that we had to create different document tables for different projects.
- Started working on the idea that different projects should have a different table for themselves.

### Day 3: The Project Document Connection
- Started working on the connection of the projects and the Documents page.
- This specific task was to open an altogether new table for different projects.
- If different documents are saved in different projects, it should stay like that and should not coincide.

### Day 4: The Categories Page
- A categories page was made which was a simple page and was completed in a single day.
- The categories input in the categories page were made such that even the projects page had access to them and could be used for assigning different categories for different projects.

### Day 5: The Edible Table Problem
- The outline of the pages was accepted but an altogether new challenge was given and it was editable tables
- The idea was to have editable tables and almost all the changes should be done from the table and there should not be many buttons on the entire page
- After spending the entire day on YouTube and different websites I came across something known as AgGrid.



## week 5
### *18th June 2024*
- Continued making the pages for the website.
- Encountered multiple problems regarding tables and session states.
- figuring out the logic for multiple project documents.
- Introduction to the questionnaire page

### *Here is the Outine of Week-5:*

1. As the blueprint was available the production of new pages was easier
2. Figuring out the logic for connecting pages and the document problem
3. figuring out the editable table problem and how to save the changes made in the table
4. the questionnaire Page Dilemma

## üìù Day-by-Day Progress

### Day 1: Figuring out the session state and the editable table problem
- Had to create multiple session states for multiple instances on a single page of the website
- research on the javascript-based grid system named Aggrid which can be implemented in Streamlit
- started creating the logic for the connection of the three pages: Project, Documentation, and Categories.

### Day 2: Creating the first AgGrid Table
- Watched videos about how to create Aggrid Tables and how to change multiple functionalities in them
- explored the documentation of AgGrid and learned about different features for the same

### Day 3: Implementing the logic of AgGrid Table
- Implemented AGgrid in all the pages wherever a normal table or data frame was being used.
- Made a big change and created a session state in which if you select a project only documents and reports of that page would be shown.
- Made the logic and Implemented it and now each project has a different set of documents.

### Day 4: The Questionnaire pages
- Started working on the questionnaire page which was a bit complex because each questionnaire contains multiple questions.
- The questionnaire page opened two table
  1. The existing questionnaire table
  2. The Questions table when you select a specific questionnaire
- Bifurcated the code into different files because it got too big 

### Day 5: The Fetching of files
- Created the logic to store all the questions that were fetched from a CSV or Excel file accordingly.
- saved the questions in a different file for better space management
- making the session state so that the table displayed below only shows the selected questionnaire table




## week 6
### *24th June 2024*
- Continued making the pages for the website.
- Encountered multiple problems regarding tables and session states.
- figuring out the logic for multipage report page

### *Here is the Outine of Week-6:*

1. Figuring out the final session states
2. Creating the reports pages
3. multiple report page dilemma

## üìù Day-by-Day Progress

### Day 1: Figuring out the idea of multiple report page
- Had to design the basic outline of how the report pages would look and feel.
- The moving of between the two report pages.

### Day 2: The first Report Page
- The first report page was a page that was supposed to take input about the report.
- It would allow us to select multiple things before letting us go to the next field.
- The Sidebar should display the project and the questionnaire details

### Day 3: The View Reports Page
- The next report page is the view reports page and it displays the reports.
- The page displays us with the report details including the questionnaire and which questionnaire has which answer.

### Day 4: The Session State between the pages
- As the button moving the two pages was a toggle button a session state had to be made so that we can toggle between the pages.
- The toggle button was challenging because all the data from the first page would be shifted to the next page.
- Created two different pages and used session state to transfer the data. 

### Day 5: FINAL SUBMISSION
- The only thing left to create was the button for downloading the EXCEL file, completed that and submitted the project.
- SUbmitted the documentation afterward.
